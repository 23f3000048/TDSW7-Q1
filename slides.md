## Financial Formulae (Math)
We model loan amortization and risk-adjusted return using:

- Interest accrual (discrete):
  \[
  A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{m}\right)^{mt}
  \]

- Risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC):
  \[
  \mathrm{RAROC} = \frac{\text{Expected\ Profit}}{\text{Economic\ Capital}}
  \]

- Present value of cash flows:
  \[
  PV = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}
  \]

Notes:
Explain assumptions: r as effective rate, m compounding periods, EC from internal model.

## Code Samples

### Python: amortization schedule

```python
def amortization_schedule(principal, annual_rate, periods):
    r = annual_rate / 12
    pmt = principal * (r * (1 + r)**periods) / ((1 + r)**periods - 1)
    balance = principal
    rows = []
    for n in range(1, periods + 1):
        interest = balance * r
        principal_paid = pmt - interest
        balance -= principal_paid
        rows.append((n, round(pmt, 2), round(interest, 2), round(principal_paid, 2), round(balance, 2)))
    return rows
```
